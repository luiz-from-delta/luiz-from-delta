# Heeeeey there! This is Luiz, glad you came here! ☺️

## Who I am

First of all, let me quickly introduce myself. I'm a Brazilian full-stack engineer that really loves learning and teaching software development, especially using the JavaScript language. I've started studying in this field when I was just thirteen years old for pure curiosity (and we all know that I wasn't the most usual kind of child, but things happen!). Since there, I've been taking advantage of all opportunities to improve my development skills and impact people's lives through digital products. To be honest, there is a funny thing about me that is about to come: I'm a biologist, believe it or not. In a nutshell, look at me as a really crazy guy, that has spent a few years studying life, metabolism, evolution, and all those insane things we learn about in biology classes, working in front of a computer every single day and night. Awesome, you now know who I am, and it's pretty nice to meet you!

Welcome to a piece of my life!
